# MongoDB $inc operator error
This example demonstrates an incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator in a MongoDB update operation. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical value by a specified amount.  However, in this case, a string ('1') is provided instead of a number (1), resulting in an error or unexpected behavior.

The solution shows the correct way to use the `$inc` operator with a numerical value.
